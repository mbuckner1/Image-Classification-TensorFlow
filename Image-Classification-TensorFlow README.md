**Overview** 
The goal of this project is to build and train a TensorFlow-based CNN for image classification. This project can classify images into predefined categories (e.g., animals, objects, or handwritten digits). The architecture is optimized for high accuracy on a given dataset, and this implementation can be extended to other classification problems. 
**Dataset** 
The dataset used for this project is CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is automatically downloaded using TensorFlow Datasets. 
You can easily replace CIFAR-10 with other datasets by modifying the dataset loader in the script. 
**Technologies Used** 
-  **Python**-  : The programming language used for this project.
-  **TensorFlow 2.x**-  : The deep learning framework used for building and training the model.
-  **Keras**-  **API**-  : Used for defining the CNN architecture.
-  **NumPy**-  : For numerical computations.
-  **Matplotlib**-  : For plotting and visualizing results.
**Model Architecture** 
The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and fully connected (dense) layers at the end. The architecture includes: 
1. **Input Layer**1. : 32x32 RGB images
2. **Convolutional Layers**2. : Extracting spatial features
3. **Max Pooling Layers**3. :3. Downsampling3. the image size
4. **Dropout Layer**4. : Preventing overfitting
5. **Dense Layers**5. : Fully connected layers for classification
6. **Output Layer**6. :6. Softmax6. layer with 10 classes (for CIFAR-10)

3. **Predict on new images**3. : You can use the3. predict.py3. script to classify new images:
bash 
Copy code 
python predict.py -- image_path path_to_image 
**Results** 
The model achieved an accuracy of **85%** on the CIFAR-10 test set after training for 25 epochs. The accuracy and loss graphs can be seen below:
